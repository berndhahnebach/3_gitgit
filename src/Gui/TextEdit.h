/**
 * Completion is a means by which an editor automatically completes words that the user is typing. 
 * For example, in a code editor, a programmer might type "sur", then Tab, and the editor will complete 
 * the word the programmer was typing so that "sur" is replaced by "surnameLineEdit". This is very 
 * useful for text that contains long words or variable names. The completion mechanism usually works 
 * by looking at the existing text to see if any words begin with what the user has typed, and in most 
 * editors completion is invoked by a special key sequence.
 *
 * TextEdit can detect a special key sequence to invoke the completion mechanism, and can handle three 
 * different situations:
 * \li There are no possible completions.
 * \li There is a single possible completion.
 * \li There are two or more possible completions.
 * 
 * \remark The original sources are taken from Qt Quarterly (Customizing for Completion).
